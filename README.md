# Active Directory Home Project
## Objective

The Active Directory Detection Home Lab project aimed to establish a real-world environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen my technical understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Learned how to create virtual servers, hosts, and SIEM environments.
- Set static IP addresses for each server and host to establish a flow of traffic to the SIEM.
- Ability to generate and recognize real-world attacks using tests from Atomic Red Team.
- Enhanced knowledge of security event telemetry and analysis.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Created an Active Directory Domain with groups and users & forwarded security event traffic to SIEM.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis // Splunk.
- Simulation of Attacks from the MITRE ATT&CK Framework // AtomicRedTeam.
- Setting up virtual environment for home project // VirtualBox.
- Gained knowledge of using operating systems // Kali Linux, Windows Server 2022, Windows 10 Home.
